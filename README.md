## Introduction
Image denoising aims to remove noise from images, enhancing their quality. This project uses convolutional autoencoders to achieve this goal, utilizing the Fashion MNIST dataset to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of clothing items. Each image is grayscale and has a resolution of 28x28 pixels. 

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Model Architecture

The autoencoder architecture consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder.

### Encoder

The encoder compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional latent representation. It consists of:

* Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and strides to reduce the spatial dimensions.

### Decoder

The decoder reconstructs the image from the latent representation. It consists of:

* Two transposed convolutional layers to upsample the image back to the original dimensions.
* An output layer that applies a sigmoid activation to produce pixel values between 0 and 1.

## Results

The performance of the autoencoder is evaluated through visual comparisons of the original noisy images and the reconstructed images after denoising. The autoencoder effectively reduces noise while preserving essential features of the original images. 

Visual results demonstrate that the reconstructed images show significant improvement in quality compared to the original noisy images. The model captures important patterns and details, indicating its effectiveness in image denoising.

Overall, the results highlight the capability of the convolutional autoencoder in improving image quality through noise reduction.
